## From Space to Concept: Our Evolution 

Founded in 2011 as a physical coworking space in Melbourne, Electron Workshop provided a home for Free and Open Source Software communities, privacy advocates, and ethically-minded technologists for a decade. During this period, we hosted Crypto Parties, WordPress events, annual Software Freedom Day summits, and were home to the Free Software Melbourne community group.

The global pandemic necessitated a reimagining of our purpose. Rather than simply closing doors, we chose to transform—preserving the community connections and ethical foundations while evolving into a conceptual framework that doesn't depend on physical space.

Today, Electron Workshop has been reconceptualized as a think tank focused on enabling tech collectives. This transition builds on our rich history of collaboration within the open source community while expanding our impact beyond physical limitations.

## Our Vision

We envision technology serving communities, not the reverse. 

Electron Workshop exists to create environments where technologists and non-technologists can collaborate to address environmental and social challenges while protecting communities from technological harm. We aim to develop frameworks and methodologies that enable tech collectives to thrive, test these approaches through practical initiatives, document and share knowledge across communities, connect disparate groups with complementary skills, and advocate for policies that support collective approaches to technology.

In the long term, we envision a world where tech collectives are a recognized, viable, and widespread approach to technological development—where communities have the tools, knowledge, and connections to harness technology for their own needs while contributing to broader social good.

## Principles of Tech Collectives

A tech collective is a community consisting of both technologists and non-technologists who possess subject matter expertise or are passionate about contributing to environmental or social causes. In its technical definition by the P2P Foundation, a tech collective functions as a Commons—enabling members to produce what they need while serving the broader community through technology, while simultaneously protecting it from potential technological harms.

We believe in:

1. **Technology in Service**: Technology should serve human needs and ecological health, not the reverse
2. **Inclusive Expertise**: Technical and non-technical knowledge are equally valuable
3. **Commons-Based Production**: Collaborative creation of shared resources
4. **Distributed Governance**: Decision-making distributed across communities
5. **Permissionless Innovation**: Freedom to experiment within ethical boundaries

## Our Initiatives

Electron Workshop operates through several key initiatives:

- **Electron Network**: Support and leverage for affiliated groups and members of the tech collective
- **Project Cinderella**: Professional sprints and hackdays to support open tech and free software projects
- **Projects Sanctuary**: A place for abandoned or under-resourced projects to find support, funding, and love

## The Team

Led by Alexar (with background in open source, startups and social enterprise) in collaboration with original founder Martin, Electron Workshop has been reconceptualized to build on collaborations with embedded developer Brian (founder of Designing Open Democracy).

Our team brings together diverse expertise across technology, community building, and social impact to guide Electron Workshop in its evolution from a physical space to a framework for enabling tech collectives.
